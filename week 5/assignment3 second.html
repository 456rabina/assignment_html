<h2>what is web design?</h2>
<p text="white"> <b>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br> refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software <br> development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop <br> browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has <br> become ever-increasingly important.</b>
